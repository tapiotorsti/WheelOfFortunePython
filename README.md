### Wheel of Fortune

F1-inspired wheel of fortune.
Made as a one-off project for a party. 
The user can add and remove names to the wheel of their choice. The program creates a json file where it stores the names to be added to the wheel of fortune. Free to use.

NOTE! The repository is missing image files for the team logos. Must be downloaded for the wheel to work. In the code, images are retrieved in the following way: "Red Bull": pygame.image.load("team_logos/red-bull-racing-logo.png")
