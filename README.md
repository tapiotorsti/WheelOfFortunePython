### Wheel of Fortune

F1-inspired wheel of fortune.
Made as a one-off project for a party. 
The user can add and remove names to the wheel of their choice. The program creates a json file where it stores the names to be added to the wheel of fortune. Free to use.

NOTE: The repository is missing image files for the team logos. You must download them separately for the wheel to work. In the code, images are retrieved as follows:
"Red Bull": pygame.image.load("team_logos/red-bull-racing-logo.png")
